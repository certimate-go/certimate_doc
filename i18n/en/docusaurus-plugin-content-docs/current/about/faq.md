## Basic usage {#basic-usage}

### Do you provide SaaS services?

No, we do not provide that. Currently, we only support self-hosted.

### Is data security really?

Since only self-hosted is supported, all data is stored on the user’s server. Additionally, the source code of Certimate is open-source, and the packaging process for binary files and Docker images is entirely done using GitHub Actions. This process is transparent and visible, allowing for independent auditing.

### Forget password?

Please refer to "[Getting Started / Configuration / Reset Password"](../getting-started/configuration#reset-password)".

### Why only 127.0.0.1:8090 can be accessed?

Please refer to "[Getting Started / Configuration / Set the Listening URL"](../getting-started/configuration#set-the-listening-url)".
